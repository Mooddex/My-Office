## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** REACT, Vite, TailwindCSS, React Router DOM

This project was built using modern front-end tools to ensure high performance, fast development, and a responsive design. I structured the app using React components and handled routing with `react-router-dom`. TailwindCSS was used for styling, which allowed for rapid UI development with utility classes.

The layout is divided into three main sections:  
- A **home page** to welcome users and direct them to cases or clients.  
- A **cases page** to view and manage current legal cases.  
- A **clients page** to view and add new clients.

The site is fully **responsive**, ensuring it works great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

## Optimizations

In the future, I plan to:

- Connect the app to a real database like MongoDB or Firebase.
- Add validation to forms.
- Use context or Redux for better state management.

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me understand how to:
- Structure a full front-end app from scratch.
- Use TailwindCSS efficiently for layout and design.
- Work with `react-router-dom` to handle multiple pages.
- Build reusable components and manage navigation dynamically.
- Build for mobile-first and responsive layouts.
